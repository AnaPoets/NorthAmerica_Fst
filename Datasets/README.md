Dataset Information
=============================
The original files were downloaded from T3 by Hongyun.
There is a description of some QC run earlier in that dataset in the Instruction.docx

On April 16,2015 the dataset was revised again. After a new QC for missingness and heterozygosity >10% 83SNPs and 72Samples were removed.
The new file contains 3,453 Samples and 2,396 SNPs. This will be used in this manuscript. 
The new file is in: ~/NorthAmerica_Fst/Datasets/Data_filter_missing_hete/NORTH_AMERICAN_QC_3453samples_2396snp.txt


The GeneticMap was downloaded from T3 for all BOPA1 and BOPA2 Described in Munoz et al 2011

Customized R script (DATA_orderSNPs_geneticMap.R) was used to order the SNPs into a genetic map position. This file will be use in Fst and PHS analysis.
There are 2,367 out of 2,396SNPs in the genetic map used. The file with ordered SNPs is called: NorthAm_3453_2367snp_geneticorder.txt
