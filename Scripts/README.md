Code for Analyses and Figures
==============================

Scripts names make reference to the terminology used in the paper.
The code for each analysis and figure is separated in folders.
Each [Analysis](Analysis_Scripts) is divided in either "input" and "output", or numerated by the order to run the scripts "Step1...Stepn"
Specific code for [figures](Figures_Scripts) in the paper can be found in the Figure directory.
